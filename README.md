# Predicting the NBA MVP(1987-2022)

## Problem Statement

Using a variety of statistics from basket-ball reference (both box-score and advanced), predict the MVPs for the last 25 years. Other things the project will look at:
* Whether voters chose the wrong MVPs during certain years?
* Who had phenomenal MVP seasons?
* Who were the most underwhelming MVP candidates during that span?

# Dataset

The dataset is webscraped directly from basketball-reference.com.  The sections of interest were the player stats, team records, mvp related stats such as vote share, and advanced stats such as VORP and true shooting percentage.
